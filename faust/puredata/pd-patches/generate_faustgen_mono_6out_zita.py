"""Build mono-to-six spatialization with Zita Rev1 for PureData.

``STEM`` identifies faust/dsp/faustgen-mono-6out-zita.dsp and the exported files.
Project-specific routing is explicit in build_patch; reusable native blocks
live in pd_helpers, while analysis and the CLI live in common.faust.
Portable source is written next to the .pd; the .svg previews its routing.

Usage: ``python generate_faustgen_mono_6out_zita.py [--output-dir DIRECTORY] [--faust EXECUTABLE]
[--check]``. --check verifies exports without changing existing files.
Importing this module generates nothing: its __main__ block runs the CLI for STEM.
